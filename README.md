# draig-dwyren
Experiment combining concepts from DRAKON and Erlang/OTP

## Purpose

- A system to combine planning and implementation of software ideas
- A graphic design language that covers processes, state machines, distributed systems
- Not targetted toward human or general processes (unlike DRAKON)
- Minimise number of modes

## Notes

- We should have our own set of "icons", don't try to be quite as abstract and brutalist as drakon.
- Loops can be either explict with `goto`s, or done as batches of work.
- Interprocess messaging should be core to IO
- 'Silhouettes' and 'async' can be replaces with state machines. Use better graphic representation that traditional ball-and-line.
